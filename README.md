# python-logical-operators

Implement the following functions which realize logical operations in case of arbitrary length input:

```python
def logical_and(*input):
    pass


def logical_or(*input):
    pass


def logical_xor(*input):
    pass


def logical_nor(*input):
    pass


def logical_nand(*input):
    pass
```
